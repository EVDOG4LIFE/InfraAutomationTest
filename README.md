# Terraform and Ansible Infrastructure Provisioning

This project contains Terraform and Ansible configurations to provision and manage infrastructure resources.

**Note**: This project is in early stages of development and serves as a learning experience. It may not adhere to best practices and is not guaranteed to function as expected. (100% guaranteed to not work right now, I will get to it when I learn more) This was primarily built hacking a lot of things together and is primarily providing me with a reference point. 

## What's Inside?

The project includes configurations for setting up infrastructure resources such as virtual machines on VMware and load balancers on F5. It also includes Palo Alto firewall configurations.

The overall goal of this is to manage a Windows server fleet. Provision the infrastructure and install the prerequisite software. 

## Next Steps

1. The current Terraform configurations and Ansible playbooks need to be tested with real-world environments and variables.
2. A CI/CD pipeline needs to be set up to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources.
3. Further work is needed to ensure the configurations adhere to best practices for security and maintainability.
